Please also note that this implementation will simply crash if you try to initialize an NSDate by passing in a string that cannot be parsed correctly. This is because of the forced unwrap of the optional value returned by dateFromString. If you wanted to return a nil on bad parses, you would ideally use a failible initializer; but you cannot do that now (June 2015), because of a limitation in Swift 1.2, so then you're next best choice is to use a class factory method.", date: "12.05.2019"),
